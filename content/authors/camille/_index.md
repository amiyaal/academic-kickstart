Camille is a PhD student studying wild rock hyraxes in the Ein Gedi nature reserve, at the border between the Dead Sea and Judean desert. She aims at understanding how ecological factors affect hyraxesâ€™ sociality. She can rely on a diversified background in behavioural ecology she acquired working on European hamsters, common elands and forest elephants. Faithful to her new study species, she wakes up before dawn and hides during the day so, if you want to observe her in her natural habitat, be ready to wake up early!
